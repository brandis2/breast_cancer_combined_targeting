# [3-D Principle Compent Analysis: Data from a combined treatment for metastatic breast cancer] (https://github.com/brandis2/breast_cancer_combined_targeting/blob/master/3-D%20PCA%20analysis.md) 
This repository illustrates the principle competent analysis carried out on several treatments targeted for metastatic breast cancer. RNA sequence analysis yielded a gene expression profile of nearly 6500 features. To explore this data we applied clustering techniques via PCA analysis to visualize and reduce the number features to 3 principle components. Our analysis showed clear clusters by each treatment and about 60% of the total variation was due to the first and second PCs calculated.
